##Logic:
1) User create list of donors accounts.
    1) Using personal account adding and removing donors
2) Scraper go to first post and gest all accounts that like this post
    1) All those accounts must be store in Data Base with additional information
3) Iterate through those accounts with range of limits
   1) If account is public
      1) subscribe on them
      2) like first few posts
      3) wrote one comment on random post
      4) Append additional information to Data Base
         1) Date of subscribe
   2) If account is private
      1) subscribe on them
      2) Append additional information to Data Base
         1) Date of subscribe
4) Once a time chek if those new account's subscribe back
5) To those new subscribers wrote a "hello message"
6) After some few weeks unsubscribe from those account

##Suggestion's:
###Limits:
If Instagram use some limits on activity, there i posibility to that they use dinamicly generated limits for account, based on history activity.
so, limits must be growing from lov activity to high
